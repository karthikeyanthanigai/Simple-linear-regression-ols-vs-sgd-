# Simple-linear-regression-ols-vs-sgd
In this repository we will see the basic different the ols(Ordinary Least Squares) method sdg(Stochastic Gradient Descent) method for a simple linear regression.
Generally in simple linear regression only one indepent variable(x) will Determine the dependent variable(y) in which we have 2 methods to predict/make the best fit line to the regression that is ***Ordinary Least Squares*** and the other one is ***Stochastic Gradient Descent***.
with this method's we will draw a good/best fit line to the dataset and find out which method is the best.

To run the code follow the below steps:

1.Install python(3.6+) and need packages.
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip instll pandas
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```
```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```

2.Clone this repository .
```
https://github.com/karthikeyanthanigai/Simple-linear-regression-ols-vs-sgd-
```
3.Open command line and set the directory to the cloned repository.
```
cd Simple-linear-regression-ols-vs-sgd-
```
4.Enter the command.
```
python simple_linear_reg.py
```

if you got any error in install the packages then refer [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).
